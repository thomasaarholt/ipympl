Welcome to ipympl's documentation!
==================================
ipympl enables the interactive features of matplotlib in the Jupyter notebook and in JupyterLab by drawing on the `ipywidgets library <https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/>`_.

Use it by calling  ``%matplotlib widget`` before creating figures with matplotlib.
